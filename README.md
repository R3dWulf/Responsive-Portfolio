# Responsive-Portfolio

In this exercise students had to create a pure HTML portfolio and then set the portfolio to manually respond to different screen sizes
when viewed on different devices using CSS. Learning the CSS necessary to get the screen to respond teaches the students what is going on 
under the hood when Bootstrap is later used.
